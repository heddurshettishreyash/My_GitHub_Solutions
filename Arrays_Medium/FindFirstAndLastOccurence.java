 * Description:
The program is designed to find the first and last occurrence of a given target value in a sorted array. If the target value is not present, it returns [-1, -1]. The implementation uses Binary Search twice, once to find the starting index and then to find the ending index, ensuring an efficient solution.

Approach:
Binary Search for Starting Index:

Search for the target value, adjusting the end pointer (end = mid - 1) whenever the target is found. This ensures that the search narrows down to the first occurrence.
Return the index of the first occurrence if found, otherwise -1.
Binary Search for Ending Index:

Search for the target value, adjusting the start pointer (start = mid + 1) whenever the target is found. This ensures that the search narrows down to the last occurrence.
Return the index of the last occurrence if found, otherwise -1.
Combine Results:

Store the results of the starting and ending indices in an array.
Return [-1, -1] if the target is not found.
Complexity:
Time Complexity:

Each binary search runs in O(log n) time, where n is the size of the array.
Since two binary searches are performed, the overall time complexity is O(2 Ã— log n) = O(log n).
Space Complexity:

The algorithm uses only a constant amount of extra space for variables, so the space complexity is O(1).
Example:
Input:
plaintext
Copy code
nums = [5, 7, 7, 8, 8, 10], target = 8
Output:
plaintext
Copy code
[3, 4]
Explanation:
The target 8 first occurs at index 3 and last occurs at index 4.
